It seems like I can‚Äôt do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

But I can still help expand the README manually with **more details**. Since your project is named **Clinical-Document-Classification-System**, I‚Äôll include likely components such as preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment support. Here‚Äôs an enriched version:

# Clinical Document Classification System

## üìå Overview

The **Clinical Document Classification System** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that automatically classifies medical text into relevant clinical specialties. It helps hospitals, researchers, and healthcare professionals organize documents efficiently and reduce manual workload.

The system uses **softmax regression (multinomial logistic regression)** as its baseline model, with scope for integrating more advanced machine learning or deep learning approaches.

---

## üöÄ Features

* **Data Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.
* **Vectorization**: TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words support for feature extraction.
* **Classification**: Softmax regression with extension options for SVM, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.
* **Evaluation**: Reports accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
* **Notebook-based workflow**: Easy experimentation in Jupyter.
* **Scalable**: Can be extended to handle large healthcare datasets.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Clinical-Document-Classification-System.git
   cd Clinical-Document-Classification-System
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. Install requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `test_case.ipynb`.

3. Run through cells in order:

   * Load dataset
   * Preprocess documents
   * Train classifier
   * Evaluate model

---

## üìä Results (Sample)

* Accuracy: ~XX%
* Macro F1-score: XX
* High performance on frequent specialties (General Medicine, Cardiology).
* Some confusion between related specialties (e.g., Pulmonary vs Cardiovascular).

---

## üìå Future Work

* Use deep learning (LSTM, BERT, BioBERT) for better text understanding.
* Expand dataset with underrepresented specialties.
* Build an API for real-time classification.
* Integrate into hospital information systems.

---

## üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Use Cases

* **Hospitals**: Automated document routing to departments.
* **Researchers**: Categorize large datasets of clinical notes.
* **Medical Records**: Efficient indexing & retrieval.

üëâ Would you like me to also include **sample commands for training and evaluating models from the CLI** (instead of only through Jupyter), in case you plan to expand the project beyond notebooks?
